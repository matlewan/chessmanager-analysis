## How to develop

1. Download data from chessmanager.com to JSON file

    ```
    cd backend-python
    python download.py
    python process.py
    ```

2. Ensure that files has been generated:
    - `backend-python/data/pomysl-grandprix/tournaments/*.py` should be generated by `download.py` if any new tournaments has been added on chessmanager.com
    - `frontend/public/out.json` should be generated by `process.py`

3. Run frontend website (development mode)
    ```
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

4. Build for production:
    - add `--base` to deploy project under a nested public path
    ```
    npx vite build --base=/pomysl-grandprix/
    ```

5. Static content for website should be generated under `frontend/dist` directory. It can be deployed by copying this directory to HTTP server, eg.
```
DIR=$HTML_DIR/pomysl-grandprix
mkdir -p $DIR
rm -rf $DIR/*
cp -r frontend/dist/* $DIR
```
